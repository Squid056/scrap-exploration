# Scrap Exploration

WIP add-on mod for Factorio Space Exploration (& Krastorio2)

Current featues:

3 new types of scrappy goodness: 
raw scrap, compresed scrap and radioactive waste
A multitude of new recipes to solve new problems created with scrap varying in difficulty increase, however no crazy changes are made in the mod that (in my opinion) ruins the SE experience  


changes a variety of recipes for both sciences and manufacturing, with some interesting reworks to certain science data cards.

Most (if not all) changes are currently still in testing, so numbers can (and probably will) be quite off in some cases. When I have more time I will run though some testing through all of the mods changes to make sure they are not too destructive.
